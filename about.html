            <p>In 2018, I took a significant step forward by enrolling in a comprehensive course covering programming, robotics, and design. 
                This marked a pivotal moment in my educational journey. It was a stepping stone for me to have a basic understanding of how computers work.

                    For the future, I am deeply intrigued by the potential of technology to solve complex problems 
                    and improve lives. Looking ahead, I envision a future where I contribute to the tech industry 
                    by developing innovative software solutions that address real-world challenges. I am particularly 
                    interested in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I plan to specialize 
                    further in these areas. My goal is to work on projects that not only push the boundaries of what 
                    technology can achieve but also ensure ethical considerations are at the forefront of technological
                     advancements. By integrating my skills in software engineering with a commitment to social responsibility,
                    I hope to make a meaningful impact on society and inspire future generations of technologists.
